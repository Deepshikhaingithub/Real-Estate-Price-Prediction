# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction

Problem Statement:

The problem at hand is to develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate the prices of houses in Bangalore, India. With the increasing demand for housing and the rapidly evolving real estate market, it has become essential for potential buyers, sellers, and investors to have an accurate understanding of property values. The availability of a comprehensive dataset containing various attributes of houses in Bangalore provides an excellent opportunity to address this challenge.

The objective is to leverage the given dataset, which includes information such as the location, size, number of rooms, amenities, and other relevant features of houses, to build a robust machine learning model that can predict the selling prices of properties in Bangalore with high precision and reliability. By achieving accurate price predictions, this model will enable prospective buyers and sellers to make informed decisions, assisting them in negotiating fair deals and avoiding both overpriced and undervalued properties.

Furthermore, the model's predictions can also benefit real estate agents, property developers, and investors by providing them with valuable insights into market trends and potential investment opportunities. By analyzing historical data, the model can capture patterns and relationships between the various attributes and their impact on property prices, ultimately helping stakeholders navigate the dynamic real estate market more effectively.

Therefore, the goal is to develop a machine learning solution that optimally leverages the provided Bangalore house dataset to accurately predict house prices, contributing to better decision-making and improving transparency within the real estate market.


**CONCLUSION**

In conclusion, this project aimed to build predictive models for Bengaluru house prices using linear regression, ridge regression, lasso regression, and XGBoost algorithms. The primary objective was to accurately predict house prices based on various features and assess the performance of each model.

After extensive data preprocessing and feature engineering, the models were trained on the Bengaluru house price dataset. The performance of each model was evaluated using the R-squared (R2) score, which measures how well the model captures the variance in the target variable.

Among the models tested, XGBoost achieved the highest R2 score of 89%, indicating that it was able to explain 89% of the variance in the house prices. This suggests that XGBoost is a powerful algorithm for predicting house prices in Bengaluru, considering the available features.

Additionally, the trained models were used to predict new house prices. These predictions can be valuable for individuals or organizations involved in the real estate market in Bengaluru, providing insights into the potential value of properties based on the given features.

It is important to note that the predictive accuracy of the models depends on the quality and relevance of the data used for training. Therefore, future improvements to this project could involve gathering additional relevant data, such as neighborhood demographics, nearby amenities, or housing market trends, to enhance the predictive power of the models.

In summary, this project successfully built predictive models for Bengaluru house prices using various regression algorithms. The XGBoost model exhibited the highest performance, achieving an R2 score of 89%. These models can serve as valuable tools for predicting house prices and providing insights into the real estate market in Bengaluru.
