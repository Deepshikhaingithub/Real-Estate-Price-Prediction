# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction

Problem Statement:

The problem at hand is to develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate the prices of houses in Bangalore, India. With the increasing demand for housing and the rapidly evolving real estate market, it has become essential for potential buyers, sellers, and investors to have an accurate understanding of property values. The availability of a comprehensive dataset containing various attributes of houses in Bangalore provides an excellent opportunity to address this challenge.

The objective is to leverage the given dataset, which includes information such as the location, size, number of rooms, amenities, and other relevant features of houses, to build a robust machine learning model that can predict the selling prices of properties in Bangalore with high precision and reliability. By achieving accurate price predictions, this model will enable prospective buyers and sellers to make informed decisions, assisting them in negotiating fair deals and avoiding both overpriced and undervalued properties.

Furthermore, the model's predictions can also benefit real estate agents, property developers, and investors by providing them with valuable insights into market trends and potential investment opportunities. By analyzing historical data, the model can capture patterns and relationships between the various attributes and their impact on property prices, ultimately helping stakeholders navigate the dynamic real estate market more effectively.

Therefore, the goal is to develop a machine learning solution that optimally leverages the provided Bangalore house dataset to accurately predict house prices, contributing to better decision-making and improving transparency within the real estate market.
